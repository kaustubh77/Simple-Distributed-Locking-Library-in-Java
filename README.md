Simple Distributed Locking Library in Java

#### NOTE: 
This code does not contain all the required dependent files but has enough to understand the distributed locking libary's user interface APIs. The files which are missing have some code from my work projects which I cannot upload.

## Features of the simple distributed locking library:

1. The library provides a simple interface to developers who want to lock their resources by creating a database locks. lockResource() and unlockResource() are the only two methods that you need to know about to work with this library!
2. You can easily configure the timeout limit for acquiring a lock and also decide the retry time to acquire a lock as per your needs.
